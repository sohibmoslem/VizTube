Tech stack
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Cloudinary
- JWT for auth
- Postman for API testing

How it works
- Client uploads a video
  - The API receives the file and metadata
  - The video is pushed to Cloudinary, which handles storage, transcoding, and delivery
  - The server stores references and metadata in MongoDB
- Users fetch and stream videos
  - The API serves metadata and secure URLs
  - Clients stream video data from Cloudinary with appropriate access controls
- Actions like comments, likes, and subscriptions are persisted via the API
- JWTs are issued on login and are required for protected routes
- All data interactions run through a clean service layer for testability

Project structure
- src/
  - api/ or routes/ – defined REST endpoints
  - controllers/ – business logic for each route
  - models/ – Mongoose schemas
  - middlewares/ – auth, validation, error handling
  - services/ – data access and external service integration (Cloudinary, mail, etc.)
  - config/ – environment configuration and constants
  - utils/ – helpers and utilities
  - tests/ – unit and integration tests
- dist/ or build/ – compiled or transpiled outputs (when applicable)
- scripts/ – maintenance and development scripts
- tests/ – end-to-end tests and Postman collections

Getting started
Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- MongoDB either locally or in a managed cloud
- Cloudinary account with a cloud name, API key, and API secret
- Git for cloning the repository
- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized runs

Quick start (local development)
1) Clone the repository
- Run: git clone https://github.com/sohibmoslem/VizTube.git
2) Install dependencies
- Run: npm install
3) Create environment configuration
- Copy the example env file and fill in values:
  - MONGODB_URI
  - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
  - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
  - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
  - JWT_SECRET
  - PORT
4) Start the development server
- Run: npm run dev
5) Test the API
- Use a REST client like Postman to hit the endpoints. The Postman collection is located in the repo (see the Releases page for assets).

Environment and configuration
Environment variables you will typically configure
- PORT: the server port (e.g., 3000)
- MONGODB_URI: connection string for MongoDB
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Cloudinary cloud name
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: Cloudinary API key
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: Cloudinary API secret
- JWT_SECRET: secret for signing JWTs
- CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET: if you use unsigned uploads
- LOG_LEVEL: debug, info, warn, error
- NODE_ENV: development or production

Tips for production tuning
- Use a process manager like PM2 or a container orchestrator to keep the app running
- Enable rate limiting and input validation to guard the API
- Store logs in a central place and monitor with dashboards
- Use a CDN-backed domain for video delivery
- Rotate Cloudinary credentials securely and refresh tokens as needed

  - Note: The server forwards the file to Cloudinary and stores metadata
- Get video metadata
  - GET /api/v1/videos/:id
- Stream video
  - GET /api/v1/videos/:id/stream
  - The endpoint returns a secure URL or a streaming manifest depending on the transport
- Add a comment
  - POST /api/v1/videos/:id/comments
  - Body: { "text": "Great video!" }

Media and streaming
- Cloudinary integration
  - Videos are uploaded to Cloudinary, where assets are stored and transformed as needed
  - The backend stores metadata and references in MongoDB
  - Clients receive secure URLs for playback, aligned with access controls
- Streaming strategy
  - Progressive streaming for broad compatibility
  - Adaptive bitrate considerations via Cloudinary transforms
  - Support for seeking, pausing, and resuming playback

Security and authentication
- JWT-based authentication
  - Tokens carry user identity and roles
  - Protected routes require a valid token
- Role-based access
  - Users, moderators, and admins can have different permissions
- Input validation
  - Validation is performed on request data to prevent invalid inputs
- Secrets management
  - Secrets live in environment variables or a secrets store, never in code

Observability and debugging
- Logging
  - Structured logs with timestamps and request metadata
- Metrics
  - Basic counters for requests, errors, and latency
- Tracing
  - Optional integration with tracing tools
- Error handling
  - Consistent error responses with codes and messages

Testing and quality
- Unit tests
  - Core business logic tested in isolation
- Integration tests
  - End-to-end flows tested against a test database
- API tests
  - Postman collection provided for manual or automated checks
- Linting and formatting
  - Style checks ensure a consistent codebase

Deployment and orchestration
- Local development
  - Run with Node directly or via a dockerized setup
- Docker
  - A Dockerfile and optional docker-compose.yml help you run in containers
  - Environment variables can be mounted at runtime
- Production considerations
  - Use a reverse proxy (Nginx or similar)
  - Run behind a load balancer
  - Separate services for API, database, and media processing
  - Use a managed MongoDB cluster if possible
  - Configure Cloudinary credentials securely
- CI/CD
  - Automate tests on push
  - Build and deploy artifacts to your environment
  - Use secrets management to protect credentials
